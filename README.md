# Weather-data
Imported through Pandas and visualised with Seaborn.
With this I have been able to conclude where in the world this weather data was recorded and why it wasn't from Australia.

# Process
Starting with a heatmap you can use this current understanding as a basis for your predictions to what the climate is typically like, this includes the amount of rain, the highest, average and lowest temperature in the region since 1901. The same goes with the Seaborn pairplot, this will yeild visual representations of correlation between all columns.
For a simplistic and reliable approach I used the line plot, this confirms the general climate doesn't have tropical seasons, the highest temperature on the recorded day since 1901 wasn't typically high, coinciding with the lowest temperature that day since 1901 being in fact much lower.
